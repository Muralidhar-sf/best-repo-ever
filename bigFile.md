The company was founded in 1999 by former Oracle executive Marc Benioff, Parker Harris, Dave Moellenhoff, and Frank Dominguez as a software as a service (SaaS) company.[4] The team wrote the initial sales automation software, and launched it to customers between September and November 1999.[5]

In July 2012, Salesforce applied to trademark to the term "social enterprise" in the United States, the European Union and Jamaica where the term was in widespread use to describe businesses with a primarily social purpose. This was successfully challenged by a campaign called #notinourname which was launched by Social Enterprise UK, resulting in Salesforce.com withdrawing their trademark application and agreeing not to use the term in their future marketing.[7][8]

In October 2014, Salesforce announced the development of its Customer Success Platform to tie together Salesforce's services, including sales, service, marketing, analytics, community, and mobile apps.[9] In October 2017, Salesforce launched a Facebook Analytics tool for business-to-business marketers.[10][11] In September 2018, Salesforce partnered with Apple intended on improving apps for businesses.[12]

Salesforce
Salesforce is the primary enterprise offering within the Salesforce platform. It provides companies with an interface for case management and task management, and a system for automatically routing and escalating important events. The Salesforce customer portal provides customers the ability to track their own cases, includes a social networking plug-in that enables the user to join the conversation about their company on social networking Web sites, provides analytical tools and other services including email alert, Google search, and access to customers' entitlement and contracts.[20]

Lightning Platform
Lightning Platform[21] (also known as Force.com) is a platform as a service (PaaS) that allows developers to create add-on applications that integrate into the main Salesforce.com application.[22][failed verification] These third-party applications are hosted on Salesforce.com's infrastructure.[23]

Force.com applications are built using declarative tools, backed by Lightning[further explanation needed] and Apex, a proprietary Java-like programming language for Force.com, [24] as well as and Visualforce, a framework[25] including an XML[26] syntax typically used to generate HTML). The Force.com platform typically receives three complete releases a year.[27] As the platform is provided as a service to its developers, every single development instance also receives all these updates.

In the Spring 2015 release a new framework for building user interfaces – Lightning Components – was introduced in beta.[28] Lightning components are built using the open-source Aura Framework[29] but with support for Apex as the server-side language instead of Aura's Javascript dependency. This has been described as an alternative to, not necessarily a replacement for, Visualforce pages.[30]

According to a September 2009 Gartner Group report,[31] Force.com had over 1,000 customer accounts. As of 2013, the Force.com platform has 1.4 million registered developers.[32]

Lightning Base Components is the component library built on top of Lightning Web Components.[33]

Community Cloud
Community Cloud provides Salesforce customers the ability to create online web properties for external collaboration, customer service, channel sales, and other custom portals in their instance of Salesforce. Tightly integrated to Sales Cloud, Service Cloud, and App Cloud, Community Cloud can be quickly customized to provide a wide variety of web properties. Community Cloud combines the functionality of the former Salesforce Customer and Partner Portals with some additional features.[34]

Work.com
Work.com, previously Rypple, is a social performance management platform that helps managers and employees improve work performance through continuous coaching, real-time feedback, and recognition.[35] It is marketed as a solution for sales performance, customer service, marketing, and as a service that can be employed by human resource departments.

Work.com, then known as "Rypple", was founded by Daniel Debow and David Stein, who wanted to create a simple way of asking for feedback anonymously at work.[36] The company was formed in May 2008 and their client list included Mozilla, Facebook, LinkedIn and the Gilt Groupe. Rypple "'reverses the onus on the demand for more feedback' by getting employees to build and manage their own coaching networks".[37]

In September 2011, Rypple announced that they had hired Bohdan Zabawskyj as its Chief Technology Officer.[38]

In 2011, Rypple developed a more formalized management methodology called OKR ("Objectives and Key Results") for Spotify.[39] Rypple also partnered with Facebook to create "Loops", short for "feedback loops", which gathers feedback from co-workers, "thank you's", progress against goals, and coaching from supervisors into one channel for a "rich, robust, continuous performance review".[40]

In December 2011, Salesforce.com announced that they would acquire Rypple. The transaction was completed in 2012 and Rypple was rebranded as Work.com in September 2012.[41]

Launched in 2005, the Salesforce AppExchange is an online application marketplace for third-party applications that run on the Force.com platform.
